-- This is necessary for VimTeX to load properly. The "indent" is optional.
-- Note that most plugin managers will do this automatically.
vim.cmd('filetype plugin indent on')

-- This enables Vim's and neovim's syntax-related features. Without this, some

-- Viewer options: One may configure the viewer either by specifying a built-in
-- viewer method:
vim.g.vimtex_view_method = 'zathura'

-- Or with a generic interface:
-- vim.g.vimtex_view_general_viewer = 'okular'
-- vim.g.vimtex_view_general_options = '--unique file:@pdf\#src:@line@tex'

-- VimTeX uses latexmk as the default compiler backend. If you use it, which is
-- strongly recommended, you probably don't need to configure anything. If you
-- want another compiler backend, you can change it as follows. The list of
-- supported backends and further explanation is provided in the documentation.
-- vim.g.vimtex_compiler_method = 'latexrun'

-- Most VimTeX mappings rely on localleader and this can be changed with the
-- following line. The default is usually fine and is the symbol "\".
vim.g.maplocalleader = ","
